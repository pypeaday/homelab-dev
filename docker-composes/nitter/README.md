What I did to get this working

I have nitter running now after changing the docker compose and using the json file for credential deliver.
I'd like to move this into the homelab officially - maybe it can be the first thing to go to k8s

I don't have archivebox using this yet - I need to go through the chromium process and it's difficult so I lost wind this morning.

don't forget that nitter is on desktop but archivebox is on server
